# Project WTWR (What to Wear?): Back End

This back-end project is focused on creating a server for the WTWR application. Working with databases, setting up security and testing, and deploying web applications on a remote machine. Eventually it will host a server with an API and user authorization.

## Running the Project

`npm run start` — to launch the server

`npm run dev` — to launch the server with the hot reload feature

### Techniques and Technology

Utilizing the express package from node.js, our project impliments routes, middleware such as mongoose to help patch our API with our database, and postman to test requests sent to the server.
